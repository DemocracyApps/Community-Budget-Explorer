- Each account type is associated with an entity:
    - Government
    - Community (is this just a civic org?)
    - Citizen
    - Media Org
    - Civic Org
    - Non-Profit
    - Other
    
We no longer have different organization types. So, really, the GovernmentOrganization is going to become an Account. 

We keep things tied to the account type designation so that it is easy to upgrade to a different organization with 
more privileges.

The first account type requires some sort of validation, if nothing else it must be associated with an official
government email address. There should be a clear indicator too as to whether a site is "official" or not. 

Perhaps even an official account can be free, but that means no custom domain and all other restrictions.

I think multi-user accounts need to be paid, but probably at a different rate than a government. Probably with some
restrictions.

But capability is NOT tied to entity type. It's tied to the plan.


There are 2 dimensions: plan level and module.

Plan level restricts basic capabilities (users or not, numbers of pages, etc.). Modules add component types.

Plan level ranges from 0 (free) to N (everything). N is a parameter as well.
